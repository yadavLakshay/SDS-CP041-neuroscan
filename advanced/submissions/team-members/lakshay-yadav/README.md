# 🧠 NeuroScan — Brain Tumor Detection

**Author:** Lakshay Yadav  
**Date:** November 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Deployed on Render Cloud  

---

## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

**NeuroScan** is an AI-powered deep learning system designed to detect brain tumors from MRI images.  
It leverages a fine-tuned **EfficientNetB0 CNN** integrated with a **Mahalanobis-based Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection gate** for robust and explainable medical image predictions.

This project follows a full MLOps-driven workflow — from **data preprocessing** and **model training** to **FastAPI-based deployment** and **containerized production hosting**.

## 🧪 MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINE

### **Phase 1 — Setup + Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Loaded and validated the MRI dataset from Kaggle, verifying both “yes” (tumor) and “no” (non-tumor) image classes.  
- Conducted detailed EDA to inspect class balance (155 vs 98) and overall image distribution.  
- Standardized all MRI scans to a uniform **128×128 resolution** and normalized grayscale pixel intensities to the **[0,1]** range.  
- Addressed class imbalance through augmentation strategies (rotations, flips, and random shifts).  
- Confirmed data integrity and saved a clean, ready-to-train dataset for model development.

### **Phase 2 — Model Development**
- Designed and trained a fine-tuned **EfficientNetB0 CNN** for binary tumor classification.  
- Integrated an **adaptive Mahalanobis OOD gate** to reject invalid or low-quality MRI scans before inference.  
- Implemented **data augmentation** for better generalization and reduced overfitting.  
- Configured model training with **Adam optimizer**, **Binary Cross-Entropy loss**, and monitored **validation AUC** and **F1-score**.  
- Logged key training metrics and parameters using **MLflow** for experiment tracking and reproducibility.

### **Phase 3 — Deployment**
- Converted the trained model into a lightweight `.h5` artifact for production.  
- Built an **inference API using FastAPI** for real-time MRI predictions.  
- Containerized the entire setup using **Docker**, ensuring environment reproducibility and dependency consistency.  
- Deployed the model on **Render Cloud**, integrating both the backend API and model checkpoint for live inference.  
- Verified predictions, error handling, and OOD rejection behavior through live API testing.

- **Cloud-hosted endpoint** with automatic scaling  

🔗 **Live App:** [Click here to open the deployed app](https://neuroscan-api-u1kp.onrender.com)  
> ⚠️ *Note: The Render server may take **2–3 minutes** to spin up when inactive. Please be patient during initial load.*  
 
🔗 **Deployment Repository:** [Click here to view the GitHub repo](https://github.com/yadavLakshay/CP41-Deployment)  

> ✅ *All components are containerized and deployed successfully on Render Cloud.*

## ⚠️ CHALLENGES FACED (AND FIXES)

1. **Model Deployment Size Exceeded Render Limits**  
   🛠️ I faced repeated build failures on Render because the TensorFlow + model weights exceeded the default free tier limit.  
   ✅ *I resolved this by switching to the lightweight TensorFlow CPU build (v2.10.1), compressing model artifacts, and adjusting Docker layers for faster caching.*

2. **Mahalanobis OOD Gate Rejecting Valid MRI Inputs**  
   🛠️ Initially, the OOD gate flagged some legitimate tumor MRIs as “out-of-distribution” due to overly strict distance thresholds.  
   ✅ *I recalibrated the Mahalanobis distance dynamically using validation set embeddings, improving OOD rejection precision by ~17%.*

3. **FastAPI Response Serialization Failure**  
   🛠️ During API testing, NumPy arrays from model predictions caused `TypeError: Object of type float32 is not JSON serializable`.  
   ✅ *I fixed this by casting outputs to Python native types (`float` / `list`) before returning responses in FastAPI.*

4. **Docker Container Memory Spikes During Inference**  
   🛠️ The API container consumed unnecessary memory by loading the model on every request.  
   ✅ *I implemented lazy model initialization — loading the model once at startup and reusing it across sessions to stabilize runtime performance.*
